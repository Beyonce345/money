        <h3>What is Inflation and How is it Measured?</h3>

        <p>Put simply, inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services increase across an economy. (Deflation, on the other hand, refers to the general decline of such prices.) While some inflation is healthy — typically around a 2 percent annual increase in prices — a rapid growth or decline in prices can have negative effects on the economy.The way in which inflation is measured is key to monitoring and managing it. Inflation is assessed through a price index, which tracks the change in prices for a basket of goods of services over time. Government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produce a number of price indices to help policymakers, business leaders, and consumers track overall price movements.</p>

    <h3>When Has Inflation Occurred in the Past?</h3>

    <p>There have been several periods throughout the past several decades with high levels of inflation. In the late 1960s during the Vietnam War, low unemployment and strong economic growth pushed up wages — leading to an increase in prices. In the 1970s, high oil prices sparked expectations that other prices would also rise. Those high levels of inflation were brought down in the 1980s due to monetary policy decisions, such as drastically raising interest rates, to lower the amount of money in the economy. However, tackling those high levels of inflation was damaging to the U.S. economy — leading to higher levels of unemployment and two separate recessions in the early 1980s.</p>

    <h3>What Causes Inflation?</h3>

    <p>There are several underlying factors that could cause prices to change. For instance, when the supply of money increases relative to the size of an economy — whether due to a surge in government spending or a central bank printing too much money — prices can rise. Likewise, events that raise production costs or disrupt the production of goods in the economy, such as wars or natural disasters, can also lead to an increase in prices. Both of those scenarios are examples of demand-pull inflation, a type of inflation that occurs when there’s too much money relative to the economy’s ability to produce goods and services.</p>

    <h3>How Does Inflation Affect Businesses and Consumers?</h3>

    <p>The rate at which prices change can have ramifications across the economy, affecting businesses and consumers alike. For instance, when high levels of inflation occur, the value of one’s money (also known as purchasing power) erodes, as consumers are no longer able to buy as much product with the same amount of money. Likewise, if wages do not rise at a similar rate as prices, inflation can devalue people’s wages and savings and increase the cost of living.Changing prices can also create disparities across the economy by distorting the purchasing power for some individuals over time. An example of this is inflation’s effect on fixed interest payments. For instance, an individual with a fixed 3 percent yearly increase to their pension would lose purchasing power if inflation were higher than 3 percent, as the value of their pension would decline. On the other hand, someone with a fixed-rate mortgage of 3 percent would benefit from higher inflation as making those payments would become easier (assuming wages also rose with inflation).</p>
