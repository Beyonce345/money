        <h3>How do I start saving money?</h3>

        <p>Begin with expense tracking. The first step to start saving money is figuring out how much you spend. Keep track of all your expenses—that means every coffee, household item and cash tip, as well as regular monthly bills. Record your expenses however is easiest for you—a simple spreadsheet, free online spending tracker or app, or even pencil and paper. Once you have your data, organize the numbers by categories, such as gas, groceries and mortgage, and total each amount. Use your credit card and bank statements to make sure you’ve included everything.

    <h3>How do I fit saving into my budget?</h3>

    <p>Make savings a monthly expense. Now that you know what you spend in a month, you can begin to create a budget. Your budget should show what your expenses are relative to your income, so that you can plan your spending and limit overspending. Be sure to factor in expenses that occur regularly but not every month, such as car maintenance. Include a savings category in your budget and aim to save an amount that feels comfortable to you. Plan on eventually increasing your savings amount to up to 20 percent of your income.</p>

Then estimate how much money you’ll need and how long it might take you to save it.</p>
